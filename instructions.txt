Deploy the etcd Operator

Creating a new etcd Operator is simple on any Kubernetes cluster. There is an example deployment manifest in the etcd Operator source repo:

$ kubectl create -f https://coreos.com/operators/etcd/latest/deployment.yaml 

This command creates a etcd Operator deployment on the Kubernetes cluster. The etcd Operator is now ready to manage etcd clusters.
Create a new etcd cluster with the Operator

Now, we'll create a 3-member etcd cluster with backup support. (Note that backup only works if your Kubernetes cluster supports Persistent Volumes). Once again, we'll use an example manifest from the etcd Operator repo:

$ kubectl create -f https://coreos.com/operators/etcd/latest/example-etcd-cluster.yaml $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE etcd-cluster-0000 1/1 Running 0 23s etcd-cluster-0001 1/1 Running 0 16s etcd-cluster-0002 1/1 Running 0 8s etcd-cluster-backup-tool-rhygq 1/1 Running 0 18s 

Interested? To experiment with more examples and explore more features, check out the etcd Operator documentation.

The etcd Operator is under active development. A lot of exciting features are planned and being developed. We'd love to see your feedback and contributions!
